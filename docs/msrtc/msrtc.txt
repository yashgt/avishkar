1. What is Phase 1 and Phase 2?

a)	Phase 1: Pilot - All ETM, with ready bus stand locations and timings
	Phase 2: ORS - All ORS routes , with data entry
	
	Problem : Phase 1 data is incomplete.
	We did lot of analysis to identify issues.
	
	Hence we suggest to break it up as 3 phases:
	
	
	Phase 1a: All ETM routes with ready and error free data 
		1000 - Given for free
	Phase 1b: All ETM routes with corrected data by Newyug where possible
		5003 - Charging Rs. 3 lakhs
	Phase 1c: All ETM routes with ready data, reported by NewYug and corrected by MSRTC
		X? - Charging Rs. 1.25Lakh
		
	Phase 2: Online Reservation System - Estimated Number of routes : 5000 - Charges of NewYug -Rs. 3lakh
	
	Prepare MSRTC timeline and submit
	
	Carry 0.3 version


Steps: CBM to set timelines

		MSRTC Traffic signs agreement with Google. Click of button
		MSRTC gives work order to Newyug for Phase 1A & 1B, 50k advance
		
		MSRTC provides latest ETM data - 1wk if not NY to go ahead with existing data
				
		Newyug converts ETM data & prepares GTFS data - 1 wk
		Newyug to submit analysis of incorrect data
		
		Newyug submits to Google
		Google begins testing - 2m
		
		MSRTC initiates rectification of data(Phase 1C) based on report submitted by Newyug - 2m
		
		Newyug works with Google to resolve queries -2m
		Google makes data ready for Go Live
		
		MSRTC performs testing
		
		When satisfied, MSRTC pays Newyug
		Newyug gives Go ahead to Google to make data Live.
		
		
Questions:
	Are the ETM system times correct based on on-ground timings?
	How many routes are operated by MSRTC
		ETM system shows 61k routes one-way. This is close to 30k to-fro routes
		MSRTC taks about 18k routes. Why the difference?

[+] Feed Has No Calendar Date Exceptions 
All trips operate on all days and hence there are no calendar exceptions.

[+] Stop Unused 
Unused stops should be ignored.

[+] Trip Duplicates 
There may be multiple trips on different routes with the exact same sequence of stops and exact same timings. These are either due to multiple buses being dispacthed at the same time or becaose these are trips that go through different paths and still connect the same locations.
Such warnings should be ignored.

[+] Route Long Name has Abbreviations 
The agency wants to have abbreviations in the route name and this warning should be ignored.

[+] Route name does not begin with a capital 
All routenames will have all characters in capital.

[+] Stop name does not begin with a capital 
The agency will be using capitals for all stop names.

[+] Stop name has stop code or id 
The names of stops will have codes. The warning should be ignored.

Other points to note:
Routes will have both short name and long name. The short name will be the code of the route and the long name will be a descriptive name that indicates the start and end of the route.

There may be trips with two or more stops with the same name. E.g.
Trip L9276 has two different stop times row( 46304 and 46309 ) with the same stop name KARANJA
The agency serves a very large geographic area and it is very likely that two places in a trip have the exact same name even though their geolocation is different.
Such warnings should be ignored.

Hello,

We have analyzed the data and have identified the following issues:
1: Some routes have no stops
These are listed in 1_route_with_no_stops.html
2: Some routes have no trip.
These are listed in 2_routes_with_no_trips.html
3: Some routes have the same stop ocurring multiple times in the sequence
These are listed in 3_route_with_stop_multiple_times.html
4: Some routes are defined in the orward direction but not in the reverse direction
These are listed in 4_routes_with_onward_direction_and_no_return.html

Kindly let us know the reason behind the above issues.

Thanks

Geocoding

Import only onward routes.
Geocode endpoints and via points.
Geocode peer stops.
Import return routes where endpoints are geocoded.

Does every trip operate at the same time everyday or are there trips that do not operate on holidays?
Does each stop on a route mean a single stopping point or can there be multiple stopping points?
How many bus depots does MSRTC have?
Does every route belong to one of the depots? We are asking this so that the data entry can be performed from one depot at a time to gradually cover all the routes.
Is it possible to determine whether a trip is operated by a Luxury Bus or an Ordinary bus?

Hi,

We have a question regarding the route names:

A route from Panjim to Margao operates trips in onward and return directions. The route has been listed in our GTFS as "Panjim to Margao". If a passenger searches for travel from Margao to Panjim, the Google Map shows him a bus titled "Panjim to Margao". This is confusing for the passenger. He should ideally see "Margao to Panjim" as the trip he is about to take is in the reverse direction.

How do you suggest we handle such a case?

Thanks

The data we have received is in a good format for us to start the project. We would be shortly visiting the MSRTC office with our proposal. For the visit to be fruitful, we are listing down the questions we have. We can dicuss these questions over phone with a suitable official of MSRTC.

Does the data contain all routes that are served by MSRTC? We just want to be sure that every route of MSRTC is covered.
Does every trip operate at the same time everyday or are there trips that do not operate on holidays?
Does each stop on a route mean a single stopping point or can there be mutiple stopping points?
How many bus depots does MSRTC have?
Does every route belong to one of the depots? We are asking this so that the data entry can be performed from one depot at a time to gradually cover all the routes.
